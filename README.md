# Introduction to Machine Learning Summer Course

For course notes, handouts, and examples see the **Notes** folder. 

## Overview

This course aims to equip students with a foundational understanding of how biostatistics and machine-learning techniques can be applied to solve real-world public health challenges. The course will start with an overview of biostatistics and linear regression, progress through data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, and dive into supervised and unsupervised learning methods tailored for disease prediction and data analysis of complex public health data sets. Advanced topics, including neural networks and ethical considerations in machine learning applications, are covered to prepare students for responsible and impactful work in the field.
